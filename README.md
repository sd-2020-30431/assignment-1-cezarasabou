I have managed to finally finish the project.

In order to run the application, you need to open the application, go in the wasteless-server folder, and run the Application class, for starting the server. For the client, go in the wasteless-client folder, open the terminal and run the command 'ng serve'.
For seeing the webpage, go in any browser and type : 'localhost:4200'.


Thank you for your understanding,
