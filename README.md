I have not managed to finish my project yet, but as you can see I have been working all week on it.
Hopefully in 2 more days I will be able to finish all the requirements. 
I am aware that by delaying the project I will get a -1 point penalty, but as it is not yet finished, please do not grade it yet. 

Thank you for your understanding,
stud. Sabou Cezara, CTIen, group 30431
